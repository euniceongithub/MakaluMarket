# Makalu - The Online Marketplace
## Introduction
Makalu is a responsive and user-friendly online marketplace designed to allow users to post and search for items without cluttering city spaces with physical advertisements. Our platform simplifies buying and selling by connecting users with items for sale in their local areas, enhancing both the seller and buyer experience.
